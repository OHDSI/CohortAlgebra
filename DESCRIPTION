Description: This software tool is designed to create new cohort(s) from previously instantiated cohorts. It uses 
    interval algebra operators of UNION, Intersect and Minus on the instantiated cohorts. Cohorts are 
    definied in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model format as a table
    with the fields cohort_definition_id, subject_id, cohort_start_date and cohort_end_date.
